0,I have a conversation with anyone and I instantly after the conversation has ended feel anxious that I said something wrong or didn‚Äôt come across as interested or I gave off a bad vibe. Today I bumped into my brother in law at the supermarket and after walking away instantly felt my chest tighten in case I came across as awkward üò¢,1
1,"I lost a great job at the beginning of the pandemic in March of 2020.  I was heart broken.  After 6 months of unemployment,  I landed the nightmare job I currently have.  I remember sitting in my car during lunch the first few days of this job and talking myself out of just leaving.   It was really bad.  The only reason I stayed was to take care of my kids.  It never got better, I worked opposite shift of my wife and kids, and the company was tough to work for.  I have had a lot of jobs, but this one takes the cake for worst job ever.  I was treated like garbage.  Despite this, I stayed for a year.  I survived 2 rounds of layoffs,  got promoted twice, then demoted.  I was targeted,  belittled,  and beaten down by my boss.  I'm writing my resignation letter today!!!!  After a year of job searching,  I finally accepted an offer!.  It's far from my dream job, but it's a step in the right direction!  When I finish working out my notice period, I am going to feel so free!  I already feel better knowing that there is an end in site!",1
2,"Well.. I‚Äôm embarrassed as can be. Panic attack got bad enough that I called 911. My heart was going faster than ever, I was so dizzy, I couldn‚Äôt breathe. By the time the ambulance was about to be here I was fully aware it was just a severe panic attack.",1
3,And when I say bitch I mean it in the sense that bitch is the most universal word in the English language.,0
4,Work just amplifies my social anxiety to the point where I question how I even have friends. I hate small talk. I hate meetings. I hate having to interact with people when all I want to do is crawl into a hole and be alone. I think all of my coworkers think i‚Äôm weird as hell and I hate that I can‚Äôt stop thinking that either.,1
5,"I had my first panic attack and was taken to the ER by my father. I was all nervous for my exam but excited too. Thirty minutes before the exam, I experienced what felt like death. In the ER I was assured by the others that everything was fine. After taking a few medications, I was alright. However, none of my friends checked up on me. I hoped that after having recurring panic attacks for three days and not attending college, somebody would notice. I feel so frustrated knowing that i‚Äôm the only one who cares.",1
6,"Usually only at night, today during the day too. What can I do? My parents think I'm just imagining it.",1
7,Yesterday morning in class I said something and my teacher snapped at me out of nowhere.,0
8,"I suffer so badly with heart anxiety mainly because I get palpitations a lot. After having about 5 ecgs, chest x ray, a 7 day holter monitor and maybe 5/6 blood tests since the start of last year and being told it‚Äôs all anxiety related I started to take upon myself to do some light exercise.",1
9,So I bought a book the other day that use low-intensity CBT techniques to treat agoraphobia. I've been slowly working through it and I'm feeling positive but it's only been a week &amp; things take time.,0
10,Does anyone know how I can forget about it,1
11,"For like 10 months on and off I‚Äôve been having ear issues. Chronic sore ear pain or stuffy ears 24/7. Crackling and popping when I swallow. And a thumping in my ear from the muscles. Also I‚Äôd wake up with slight tinnitus every morning that would get better as the day went by. Also sometimes I‚Äôd feel a pressure change in my ear and tinnitus would start up but would only last for like 30 seconds then go away. Lately I fell it‚Äôs been getting worse my ears not only hurt but feel more sensitive with loud sounds my ears vibrate now or crackle and sometimes I feel the muscle spasm in ear as well. I‚Äôve been really depressed about this. I going to see a ENT I really can‚Äôt take this anymore, does anyone else have an issues like this?",0
12,"My anxiety has gotten better over the years, but I still let ‚Äúscary‚Äù things pile up and then get more anxious about them the more I let them build (y‚Äôall know how it is!) But, once in a while, I will get a burst of confidence and knock five things off my scary list at once. For example, the other day I set up a doctors appointment, resolved something with my pharmacy, submitted a maintenance ticket, got an estimate for a car repair, opened an email I had been avoiding, and dug into an intimidating project at work. That‚Äôs more than I can typically handle in a month. Does anyone else get this? Is there a way to harness the power?",1
13,The 1st shot I was a mess beforehand. Even the xanax barely helped. But I did it. Only has a sore arm and woke up sweaty lol. But I hear the 2nd shot is more likely to really beat you up. My dad's 2nd he felt nothing. My teenage siblings felt achey and fatigued. Hope I don't get it bad. I'm going to drug myself again and go get the 2nd shot today...,1
14,I felt head tremors twice this week I think due to my anxiety. I feel the tremors in my hands and chest sometimes too. Is there anything I can do to treat these tremors naturally? Do they progressively worsen? I'm due for my second covid shot in a few days and concerned now because of the head tremors. Anyone else get these tremors?,1
15,So i think more than a week ago. I posted about having this anxiety and how i get bloated then it would lead to not being able to breath then would lead to an attack. Its a vicious cycle.,1
16,"I have been taking Buspar for several years now for anxiety (now 15mg 3x a day) and it works wonders. However, due to an upcoming situation I have landed in the hospital twice in the last 2 weeks with severe anxiety attacks. Yesterday they couldn't get my heart rate down even shooting me up with Ativan. So the hospital doc put me on Klonopin twice a day (.5mg) to get me through the next month. I took it last night and slept fantastic, but have been up 2 hours now and still ""hungover"". Is this normal??",1
17,"I don't have a god damn comfort zone. I have panic attacks alone in my apartment in bed. Going to work every day is so outside my comfort zone that all I can do when I get home is collapse in exhaustion. Going to the kinds of group gatherings everyone seems to think will help me make friends might as well be skydiving, it gives me that much terror.",1

19,"I've been dealing with pretty massive anxiety for the last 3 months.  Currently taking Seroquel and it works one day, does nothing the next.  I feel awful today truthfully.  I've kind of realized most of my anxiety is physical related.  Tight chest, nausea, headaches.  I've been reading that Propranolol is great for getting rid of the physical aspects of anxiety.  DAE have success with Propranolol working with what I'm describing?",1

22,"Anyone else have crippling anxiety over everything? I have always been kind of nervous about things and had some anxiety. It‚Äôs gotten to where every little thing feels me with fear though. Rather it be going out in traffic, going out to eat, having a conversation, or anything.",1
23,"I just could not shut off my brain last night night. It was like my body was actively fighting sleep. I'm currently switching meds. I was on Zoloft for 6 months. Which was not great for me. Now after doing the genesite test, they're trying me on Effexor. I know stopping one SSRI and starting another is always not going to be the smoothest. I just could not calm down last night. I had a headache and my skin almost felt like it was crawling a bit. Are these normal things to expect when switching meds? I'm only 6 days into effexor.",1
24,"I'm trying to post this on different subs to get an opinion.  My wife hasn't been sleeping well lately due to our nightly nursing toddler, and has been particularly exhausted.  She isn't diagnosed with anxiety but I think she has some form of it. Sometimes when she's stressed or when she's worried about something she'll get nauseous and vomit and diarrhea.  Anyways our son was having a rough night last night and  wife was overtired and nauseous, and commented that whenever she tried going to sleep, her breathing would slow down or even pause and she'd wake up to catch up.  She wasn't waking up choking so she doesn't think its OSA.",1
25,"Hello. I am a 15-years-old Introvert that also has social anxiety. So I have this one friend that is a good. Me and her have known each other for years now but have only started getting closer and started chatting alot (Keep in mind this entire story does not include anything that happened in real life it's only online). So slowly I started getting used to her because we chat alot so then my guard went down and I am not too much of an introvert with her. In chat. But at times I try to be friendly with her since she always makes me happy aswell. So usually when she sends me a picture of herself and asks what I think I try to support her and compliment her with compliments like You look cute, You have a nice smile and etc. But after doing that I always just get myself worried since I feel I am being too friendly which could be a problem since I don't want her to think I like her as anything other than just a really close friend since that's not my intention here. Also at times I could apologize for talking too much since I really enjoy talking to her but I wanna make sure I am in the good side by apologizing since I am worried something wrong happens. I also apologize alot if I do something wrong because once again I don't wanna lose her, her being my only closest friend who is a girl. But then I feel worried maybe apologizijg too much is annoying and it's just a never ending loop. I also usually take no time to reply to her which I heard isnt too good to do. But I am also quite worried since school starts soon for us and she also wanted to play games together but I am not really used to talking to girls since as said she is my only close friend who is a girl And I would be so much more of an introvert IRL or in a call. Since I don't wanna be too awkward. She is an introvert aswell but less than me. I just don't always know if she started hating me or not.. It's painful. Sorry for the long story, Help if you can.",1

28,"It has been more than 2 years since I have learned about the truth and I have been trying to forget about the wrongdoings of the person, however I still get reminded of it at times and I feel a lot hatred towards the person. I was deceived and taken advantage of for 6 years, I hate all the memories, moments, time and money I have invested on this person. The worst character I have ever came across and led me to trust issues and distancing from people.",1

31,"Currently I'm studying but I feel like when i finish university and going to work I'll have people constantly testing me or comparing with me, and I know no one will be there for me. I don't know what I'll be working on. If I regret my job? If I just end alone working and not knowing what I really want to do? I see many people working all day every day and I ask myself wether I'll be able to handle it. Uni is sometimes just hard. There's so much people better than me in many ways that i don't know if I will be able to get anything. I'm constantly thinking wether i'll have regrets in the future and I just can't continue like this. It's a so intrusive thought and maybe i'll change my career but maybe I regret that too...",1
32,I am struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks. I feel like my family doesn‚Äôt support me at all. I always get the ‚Äújust calm down‚Äù responses from them. These are my in laws considering that my actual blood family (my mom; my dad passed away) responds the same way as well. I am having a hard time with day to day things‚Ä¶ even going to work. I do my best to hide it but today I really broke down. And the responses that I am getting are hurting me even more. ‚ÄúOh my god‚Ä¶why are you crying now?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong now?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say anymore‚Äù These are the people I look towards for support because they are the only people I have. I don‚Äôt have any friends which is sad at my age (31). Sometimes I just don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to..or be a friend‚Ä¶.I feel like I am on my last straw here with my panic attacks and anxiety‚Ä¶..I feel like I am crying out for help with no support besides myself‚Ä¶..I can‚Äôt do this anymore‚Ä¶..,1

34,"my social anxiety is horrible. i can handle hanging out with one or two people but anymore makes me so anxious and i just want to leave so desperately. it‚Äôs like these alarms in my head start blaring because i know i‚Äôm going to have to endure conversation i‚Äôm not a part of nor do i know about, inside jokes/references i won‚Äôt get and will have to awkwardly listen, etc‚Ä¶ now im a very good conversationalist and i am in no way bad at being in a group, but i just hate being there.",1

38,"I just got to college. I used to be a really mean person and a bad friend in high school. Over quarantine I had a whole personality revamp and changed myself COMPLETELY because I wanted to be a better, pure person. I think I succeeded in that, because I got to college and was trying my absolute hardest for the first 3 weeks to be nice to all of the new people I was meeting. Everything was going well, I had even started talking to this guy I thought was cute and one of the things he said he liked about me was how caring and comforting I was to be around. This obviously made me happy because this was the goal of my whole personality change over quarantine. This guy is super nice, we weren‚Äôt in a committed relationship by any means, we were just talking. But, I fucked up last weekend. I got super drunk when I went out and ended up kissing his friend. Naturally this guy found out and I felt so extremely shitty about it the entire next day. It actually sparked a panic attack for me which made me go home because I couldn‚Äôt handle the guilt and anxiety. I ended up talking to the guy in person and we worked everything out- he claimed to not be mad and said he felt like he just wanted to be friends with me for a few days, so he was glad we were having this conversation. However, for the past week since the incident, there has been this god awful, lingering feeling of anxiety in my stomach over this entire situation. Am I a good person still? I try SO HARD to be and I feel like this one mistake set me back light years. I want to give up and literally die, I feel like the shittiest person ever and this feeling of anxiety that comes with is not helping my mental health at the moment. I still hope I‚Äôm a good person, my intentions were never to hurt anyone. Had we been in a committed relationship/set boundaries I would never in a million years do something like that.",0
39,"Hey, so I myself am suffering from anxiety since the time I can remember, but all I heard from my parents and family members was that I feared a lot (was a coward in other words). And I thought I was like that I didn't know that it was a suffering from GAD until recently when I just wanted to die. I searched for my symptoms online and found out I had GAD. Since then I have been doing a lot of research about it ...reading books, videos , etc.",1
40,"Hey everybody! I‚Äôm an introvert, HSP, and I have an anxiety disorder. It‚Äôs always been energetically draining for me to be around people and to be out in the world, even (sometimes especially) when I‚Äôm with people I like and doing a fun activity. I just get over-stimulated, which zaps my energy and can trigger my anxiety because I start having thoughts along the lines of, am I going to be able to get out of this situation before I crash/etc. I usually just muscle through it and then go home and collapse. Especially now, in this COVID era when I don‚Äôt have as many opportunities to flex my social muscle, I feel the weight of having to go out of my comfort zone and do social things. On the other hand, I want to be a person and maintain my relationships! So, do you guys relate to what I‚Äôm describing at all? What tools do you use to deal with it?",1
41,"Hello guys! I‚Äôve always suffered from anxiety but I somehow managed to keep it under control. This month my dearest cat, my little kid, my everything, almost died 2 times and we had to run to the vet to save him. He hasn‚Äôt recovered fully yet, but he is better now. I spent all my savings and made some pretty big debts to save him and now I find myself struggling with a HUGE anxiety anytime I am alone with him. I always wonder if he is gonna get ill again, where will I get the money from to save him, how am I gonna get to the vet in time and I know it‚Äôs all in my head but I just can‚Äôt control myself anymore..

42,"As ridiculous as it may sound, a short while ago while I was at my computer I felt pretty dizzy. Now, this was at around 2:30 AM and I'd been looking at my screen for a long time. No symptoms before tonight however, and it has gotten worse since then further scaring me. There's been some on and off pain in my head that comes with the dizziness but I'm not having coordination or balance problems as of now.

46,Im in high school. I wasted my whole school life doing nothing and just wasting air. I decided this year if participate in things more. I have bad public speaking skills. I don't study well. I cheated this whole 2 years of examination. I decided I'll do smt so I participated in an internship for whichs interview I failed( for vice president and other positions) I do think I'll do well if I get a chance and ik I'd be a good leader my slef esteem is just destroyed. Anyway I had a model UN assembly in our school and I wanted to give my name and we had interviews. I messed up so bad I stuttered so much so so much. They teachers even laughed. Ik I failed but I'm so mad I thought I could do smt for once in my life. I feel so worthless I didn't even answer their questions properly. I can't even do my best. It's not like it's my first time giving an interview I did so much better before even. I even dissapointed my friends cause when I'm comfy with them I come off as too rude and aggressive. I ahte being looked down on but all I can think abt is everyone I meet looking down on me. I'm so done with everything.,1

53,"I been having anxiety and depression problems since my early teens (28 now) and for the past few months felt better than ever with no meds or anything until I injured my eardrum few weeks ago... I can handle pain quite well that was not a problem, not fun either but manageable. The real horror started with vertigo (got an inner ear inflammation because of the eardrum problem that gave me constant dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea) and of course my old friend anxiety kicked in and been having constant anxiety and panic attacks since then. After the ear cleared out i had chest tightness and tingling in left arm, so I freaked out even more and went to A&amp;E, and after blood samples, x rays of heart and lungs everything was in perfect condition so the doctor told me it's my anxiety. I felt better the same day, but then in next few days i started filing tingling in my left cheek, and last night tingling in arm and face got worse, started getting worried and panic attack kicks in wit a headache and shortness of breath and trouble concentrating on whatever people are telling me in that moment so I  make another trip to the A&amp;E with the same result (but without x-ray or mri because doctor was so confident it's just stress and anxiety, as he explaind me if it was something more serious, i would loose muscle feeling so my face would droop, and I wouldn't be able to move my hand). I had million panic attacks and anxiety issues over the years but they've never gave me such physical symptoms that lasted for days and weeks, so whoever is reading this, go and check yourself out definitely - but don't panic, because if you think it's your head it probably is.",1

55,"To get down to it. I unfortunately had ‚ÄúPhone sex‚Äù in my case, meaning just texting the other recipient dirty texts and they wanted to send nude photos but I never sent any in return. Which most people do, but if my parents found this out, they would stop talking to me entirely, be extremely disappointed, and my distant family as well would stop talking to me due to beliefs so telling them to get this off my chest is NOT an option AT ALL.

66,"Hi all! Me (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) moved in together at new apartment about 2 months ago, and we left my bike sitting on our second story balcony, we figured there was no way that anyone would be able to get it down from there. Well, a couple weeks ago we had a friend over and we were talking pretty loud, and the walls are pretty thin in our complex and my boyfriend suddenly stops and said ‚Äúdid you guys hear that‚Äù? We all kind of thought nothing of it because as I said the walls are thin and it honestly wasn‚Äôt really anything too out of the ordinary, so we didn‚Äôt really bother checking. A couple hours later we walked our friend down to her car and there was a ladder on the side near our balcony which we thought was crazy because we had been talking about that, and we look up and the bike was gone. Ever since I‚Äôve been afraid to be home alone (especially at night) even though I logically know they won‚Äôt come back or break in but my anxiety is getting the worst of me. At first it wasn‚Äôt too bad because my boyfriend and I worked basically the same schedule, but I since quit that job and am now home a little more often, usually without him and he works closing shifts. Some days are better than others but I‚Äôm really starting to get sick of the fear because it‚Äôs almost unbearable and quite frankly just annoying. And I just feel so stupid that I‚Äôm an adult who‚Äôs afraid to be home alone. I‚Äôve been thinking about getting a dog but other than that I‚Äôm kind of out of ideas. Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with or get rid of the fear and paranoia?",1

78,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm a 27F who‚Äôs had a terrible time since April of this year and I feel defeated. I need guidance. I need true reassurance because I can‚Äôt believe all my symptoms are anxiety related. In April of this year I had a minor surgery to drain a cyst - totally unrelated (or maybe not?) during recovery I started to feel my first symptoms: tingling legs with restless legs. I‚Äôd never felt this in my life so I went to the ER, thought my antibiotics weren‚Äôt sitting well with me. I had my heart checked and blood word - was told it‚Äôs anxiety. About a week later I was grocery shopping, felt a sharp pain in my left arm that travelled to my chest and it was painful to breathe. I drove home in a panic, had my first ever panic attack once I got inside. Everything was numb and tingling, my face, body, my hands were curled up, my lips curled up, I couldn‚Äôt breathe, we didn‚Äôt know what was happening so my boyfriend rushed me back to the ER. Checked my heart again and was told it was a panic attack. A week after that my chest had a constant burning pain for a couple days, went back to ER and was told my chest wall was inflamed - prescribed naproxen for 10 days. The tingling in body continued on and off during this time and after. I felt better in the sun in the summer. Beach days were my favourite, I felt happy and my symptoms subsided. Symptoms would come and go throughout summer though. I started getting really cold - freezing. Doctor requested blood work. Everything was normal but my B12 level on a scale of 138-620 pmol/L was 192pmol/L and iron on a scale of 5-250 was at 30. I had been googling my symptoms during this entire time, scared to death I have MS. Palpitations, leg twitching, heaviness in legs and pins and needles in feet when driving. Last week I had an appointment with my GP for a full neurological exam. I passed everything. My doctor said because I had an MRI in February of this year and it came back clear (along with me passing the neurological exam) MS was highly unlikely. I brought up my B12 and Iron levels being low and my lifelong stomach issues maybe not absorbing these vitamins being the cause of my neurological symptoms and my doctor told me not to worry about those because they‚Äôre still within range. She then told me it‚Äôs anxiety and she‚Äôd like to put me on medication and therapy. I feel defeated because I don‚Äôt know how anxiety can cause these symptoms. I was diagnosed with situational anxiety as a teenager but that was just heart palpitations and nausea - nothing like this. It‚Äôs like my mind won‚Äôt accept anxiety for an answer and I‚Äôm almost praying it‚Äôs the low vitamin levels and nothing more serious. I feel helpless, I want to feel normal again, not worry about my future and present symptoms. Has anyone else had a similar situation or even a similar B12 situation? Anything helps.

That year there were a lot of visits to the emergency room, hospitals and my doctor. They suspected something could be wrong with my heart, and had to have a 24h EKG a couple of times, and they did an ultrasound of my heart. Nothing turned up, and my heart was healthy. No one thought to suggest that it could be anxiety, so I went on with my life and it stopped for a while.

138,"Hey y‚Äôall, First time poster in this subreddit, long time lurker. I‚Äôm writing this because I‚Äôm seeking advice and/or suggestions on what I can do to turn myself around. My initial thoughts of how my dark thoughts and outlook on life started is when my parents got divorced around the time I was 7. Leading up to around my HS graduation and even sometimes now, my parents would leave me in the middle of their situations and use me as leverage in court hearings. My parents have been very heavy drinkers ever since I can remember and one scarring even that I remember from my parents is when my father threatened suicide by cop while I was in the house during one of his heavy drinking phases. Till this day both of my parents drink heavily and I feel little to no remorse for them anymore as I tell them that their bodies will no longer keep up with the abuse. My HS school years were not horrible as I had a girlfriend from grades 10-12, all star athlete, worked a part time job, and graduated top 10% of my class. There are several things through HS that I regret and wish I could turn around: 1) Get my License(still don‚Äôt have like a dumbass) 2) getting a girlfriend. My girlfriend and I had several breakups, countless arguments, and continued the relationship for way longer than we should have. We broke up on bad terms and it is something I regret to this day, but more emotions would spark if I apologized rather than leaving it be and letting her live her life. The breakup occurred around the middle of my senior year and shortly after was my first experiences with marijuana. Following my breakup, I took a look at myself in the mirror and hated what I saw. I am 6‚Äô3 and at the time of the breakup I weighed 270 pounds. Currently, I am 185 pounds and have maintained this weight for several years now. I thought by losing the weight I would gain confidence and energy, but this hasn‚Äôt been the case. This led to my marijuana abuse in my freshman year of college. I made friends, memories and quite a bit of money through weed in my freshman year but it drained me even more than the weight loss. Leading into my 2nd year of college, I quit using marijuana for about 6 months and as a result I lost all of my friends. Through this period, I had a lot of trouble maintaining my anxiety(something I should see a therapist about) and just finding things to do or enjoy. I would consider two people my friends and they aren‚Äôt even people I can talk to about anything an can rely on for advice. I have trouble relaying my thoughts to them in fear of them not understanding my circumstances or just simply not caring. I find it hard to find people with similar interests as me in my area. All of my HS peers seem to either be engaged/pregnant, brainwashed by Leftist-College propaganda, or trying to become the next big social media influencer. I become very lonely when I can‚Äôt share my interest in a certain subject, talk about commonalities, or drive around and go do something. Currently, I have just started my junior year in college and am quitting marijuana again, but not because of abuse of it, I just feel the need to quit uplift my mood. I know I should probably seek a psychiatrist to pinpoint my anxiety and NEED to get my license as it makes me feel like a complete failure that I don‚Äôt have it at 20 years old. I feel like a idiot for even writing this, but I have no one to talk to in regards of advice and wanted to get all of this off of my chest. I just feel like I have wasted the past 6 years of my life and will end up like my parents. I would like to enjoy the feeling of not being an outcast or loser in my mind again. I have never seen suicide as a solution to any problem and I would hate to see myself become addicted and brain dead through antidepressants, but I feel like the things I enjoyed in the past to reduce stress just make me more frustrated and annoyed with life.",1

158,"I am fucking over everything... I am a college senior and the thought of graduating in May makes me cry. You see, I have a chaotic home life and the thought of having to move back into that chaos is so anxiety provoking. I have my dad who is emotionally volatile and any thing can set him off. Sucks to be around someone like that..never know when he is going to go off. I feel like there are so many expectations that come along with getting older and I still feel as though I am 19/20, even though I am 22. In some ways, I miss high school-I miss being young. I don't know...I just feel so mediocre compared to everyone else. Everyone around me has these crazy opportunities that come their way and I struggle even to reach out. Getting my current internship was such a challenge and I already fucked it up. There's a certain way that I want to execute myself and I'm pissed that I can't come across the way that I do in my mind. I can do so much more. Then, I hate being a friendless senior. It sucks. On one hand, it's my fault that I don't do more to stay in contact with people and consistently go to club meetings. Then its so stressful to hear people around me talk about post-grad life and they talk about in such a negative way. Yes, working is  fucking hard, but I feel like for me, I have to work... or else, I will just keep getting deeper in my anxiety. Plus, I don't even know what I want to do with my life...I feel so mediocre. Then on top of that, I have horrible body image issues and fucked up eating habits because I am very overweight and I'm short. So that fucking sucks. Then I feel like once you reach a certain age, people expect more from you. I am 22 and still live at home, only first had an internship and the remarks from people just make me feel like a fucking failure. I'm like 22 and people still think I'm in high school...how demoralizing when in just a couple of months I will be a college graduate. I used to see a fucking therapist but he was a complete asshole who made me feel like shit every time I left the appointment. I already carry so much shame and shit that he said didn't help. Each session he was like ""Oh you went to residential remember this..."". Bitch, that was fucking 3 years ago..I can barely remember what I did yesterday. Then this fucking asshole months ago implied that I wouldn't get my driver's license. I explained my situation to him over and over again and he still wasn't fucking grasping it. Well I passed anyways, so fuck him. His fucking remarks are the only reason why I passed because I wanted to prove this asshole wrong. Getting my driver's license was such a major accomplishment for me and his reaction was so subpar. I was so excited. Oh and then on top of that, I feel different from other people with anxiety disorders. Other people seem like they are still able to have friends, go to parties, network and do other shit. Well, I fucking struggle like there is no tomorrow with that. Now back to the asshole therapist, he fucking implied that I was a hermit and for weeks, he would badger me on dropping the sorority I was in. I fucking hated this sorority and was he the one paying for it? NOPE!!!!!!!!! pLUS it was so cliqueish and it ended up shutting down.",1

With like a bit of whooshing sounds coming every now and then (like wind blowing. So today i was blowing my nose because my nose has been feeling STUFFYYY for days like I got the cold on Monday/late weekend and now it‚Äôs Friday and my nose has been feeling so full and every time I blow there‚Äôs like a bubble in there and I blow it back up and it goes in my throat and I swallow and I choke and so on. But 24/7 it feels like there‚Äôs a build up of snot and congestion and my throat sounds so nasally 24/7 it‚Äôs so hard to breathe from my nose so I was blowing and blowing and it‚Äôs so hard to get the snot out like when it did come out it was yellow and white and sticky and looked like cottage cheese and in my nose it had kinda a blue tinge but then I blew it out and it was either yellow or white and it was so sticky and thick. And i kept on blowing and blowing and more kept on coming it was so hard to get out idk if this is like build up  for days or something else I need to get checked out cos this carried on for like a full 10 or 20 minutes and u still feel bubbles in my nose EVERYTIME I breathe and stuff and it feels full. So is this all normal? Is this part of the cold? I also coughed up like yellow mucus too a couple times. I‚Äôve also been rubbing my nose so much there‚Äôs like a red bump at the opening inside my nose lol. Will this all go away soon or a sign of something more serious like an ear infection or something else I need to get treated?

168,Hi I‚Äôm new to this subreddit and am currently dealing with anxiety from the loss of my father in December of 2020. After my father passed away in December of 2020 I had been doing well I never felt anxious about anything really but after I got a new job in August where I‚Äôve been more isolated I‚Äôve had multiple breakdowns where I relive the night when my father died. I brought it up with a female friend and my girlfriend. After that it felt good to finally let people know what I was going through and it was the first step for me to get help. But now whenever I see my female friend post anything online I get extremely anxious and feel trapped. My mind has associated seeing her with my anxiety and it seems to be getting worse. I am going to bring this up with my counselor next week and see what he thinks i should do but I think cutting contact for with her for awhile might be the best solution. Please let me know if anyone else has had this and what they did to help it.,1

226,"In 2020 I participated in a weight loss challenge and was part of a group of 10 people who didn‚Äôt win but were all runners up and were invited to attend the company‚Äôs convention and meet everyone at the beach. I was also added a group chat where we chatted monthly and caught up. We also all interact over Instagram and all was well. Will with COVID the convention was moved out a year to this weekend. I stopped being super active on Instagram after a family loss and getting pregnant and being sick so I wasn‚Äôt super active for like 5 months. I was still occasionally responding to the group chat and they talked about the upcoming event and told us that ‚ÄúJim‚Äù would reach out to us with hotel info. Well, then I didn‚Äôt hear about it for 3 months. So I assume it‚Äôs cancelled and don‚Äôt have time to think of it because of the pregnancy anyway. WELL now everyone is posting pictures going/being at the convention. I message my friend in the group and she told me she just thought I couldn‚Äôt make it‚Ä¶so basically‚Ä¶was I just forgotten?

Not a ton of anxiety, like it‚Äôs very manageable compared to what it was a month ago. Anyways I feel relatively ok, other than the insane amount of intrusive thoughts/worry that I‚Äôm having.

I love my relationship. And another example I could be watching my favorite show or playing my favorite game and then I question why I‚Äôm playing it if I should be playing or is it ok to be sitting inside playing?",

It's a health anxiety and if someone told me I didn't have this condition with 100% certainty, I would be so happy and it would stop. The problem is, there's no way to test for it and give a yes or no diagnosis. I've been tested for it and told that I likely don't have it, but I still experience the symptoms out of nowhere and the only people that I know have these symptoms are the people that have this illness.",

You are delusional if you think they work, common knowledge about them is that they just make you a robot, a yes/no person. Fuck that! Since last month I‚Äôve been taking some actual useful pills. I introduce to you‚Ä¶ Valium! Yall should try this shit out, works like a motherfucker. And btw, your doctor is most likely scum on the earth if they push antidepressants on you. Sure, 1 or 2 prescriptions might be fine, but FUCKING 7? No shot. Not to mention every single one gives their own side effects which is lovely. Love having brain zaps all the time!",

I only eat 2-3 times a day mostly 2 so it's not like I am doing this 4-5 times a day average. I am also short and ate close to nothing when anxiety truly was controlling my life. I'm not as concerned about the weight gain (even though ya I'm not happy about it) I'm more concerned about the larger portions and needing to feel full. When I talked to my psychiatrist she said she didn't see it as a problem because in her opinion I was too skinny and I do it during 2 meal times. Does anyone else feel with their medication (or without) they HAVE to feel FULL?",

However when I was alone I realized how many people around me might feel that way.

Don't get me wrong I have amazing friends who help me loads... but I just can't help but think how no one is going to wanna put up with me, how tired people may feel when I get anxious around them.

I woke up not too long after and now I have all this mucus in my chest, but I can barely cough if you can even call it that. Like physically I can‚Äôt cough anymore. Now my anxiety is telling me that it could be because my lungs are too weak from coughing to cough anymore and that I should probably just go to the ER, but rationally I think it‚Äôs just the medicine.

I didn't even notice the teenager open the door while I was pulling out and I finally did and abruptly stopped and rolled down my window and started spewing out apologies. Who I assumed was the father rolled down his window and reassured me everything was ok. I didn't hit anyone or anything but I felt like a major asshole for not being as attentive as I should have.

280,"Before I say anything im definitely going to get myself referred for evaluation on this. It's a strange one because of another component. Im an alcoholic. I guess ill just run through the story quickly. I was hospitalised in January due to withdrawal trying to quit and it was quite traumatic. I spent five days there in sheer panic and anxiety but I was safe. When I was released this us were things started to get a little, off. Before bed. I would start doing things in threes. Pull the handle of my door to make sure it was locked three times, rubbed my Witcher medallion I have over my mirror three times, then for some reason lightly tapped my chest three times. And I would pull on my e-cig three times during the day, other times not. It always thought of it as good luck. I did this for about two-three months until one night I thought why the fuck am I doing this? And it stopped, I stopped thinking about it. And that was that. Until I started drinking again and had withdrawal (not as bad, cut the relapse short). Now im three weeks sober, this night time ritual of threes is happening again like the last time.  Also, this threes thing never happened before the start of this year and I've not always been an alcoholic so I have no clue where it came from. And it's only this night time thing and my e-cig that I can think of so it doesn't really interfere in my life. But it does worry me.",

I wanted to get a 2 day a week job for 8 hours to make the most but this job I‚Äôm having a trial at today starts at 7. I never actually calculated how long 8 hours would be, like I said not enough hours in the day. Which means getting up at 5/5:30 minimum so I‚Äôm not late coz I always am til half 4. Plus waking up in the dark makes me feel shitty and being tired generally makes me fragile. I like waking up by the sun or naturally not by alarm and although the work of this job is something I‚Äôd enjoy they said ideally they would want me to work 3/4 days and the time I have to be up by now is killing me the thought of it.

Along with that I'm on my period which isn't helping. I'm just not sure what to do now, and I'm getting really scared.",

Right now my fears of dying and going insane are even more powerful, and i am really afraid that i might lose my mind because of the grief. Did anyone else experience this?I really would like some tips on how to handle this",
322,"I just turned 18 today, and I have life plans that I love working towards. It's just too hard to achieve them currently. So I gave myself anxiety when I was going into 9th grade, (5 years ago) just believed i had it so much that I developed a problem, and I've been fucked ever since. Except for about a 3 month streak where my parents made me fight through the anxiety, put me on a plane to England, (with my dad) and my anxiety just vanished once I was there. We got back a few days later and I felt great still, I even got a job for a couple months. Then covid started so I left the job, stayed at home, and now I'm useless again. It's a different type of anxiety from before my trip though. This anxiety stems almost entirely of a fear of throwing up in public. Before my trip, if I were to throw up in public, I would have been horrified, but that wasnt really a concern I had so it never happened. Now though, I basically can't go anywhere unless I've been there before, and I know where the bathrooms are. I took another trip recently to Calgary (where I want to move to and start a life in) hoping it would just click my brain back to how it was after England. It kind of did, it made me very motivated and excited to get my act together and work towards moving out there. But it didn't completely kill my fear of throwing up. On that trip, I couldnt get on the train, I had a breakdown as it was coming in because there was no way I would be caught throwing up on a train and getting weird looks from everybody. That's when I realized I need to fix this. When I got back home I tried researching it, all I got was agoraphobia stuff. I do believe it's partially agoraphobia, but the results weren't really accurate. The cycle of events is, I feel fine, I think about how I'm feeling fine and start to panic, when I got anxious I feel like I'm going to throw up, when I feel like I'm gonna throw up I get anxious, and so on and so on. I don't thinks it's just agoraphobia because I don't have a fear of it really if I'm at home, like obviously I don't like throwing up, but I know that if I have to, I can. But in public places or transport etc, I know I can't throw up there, which makes me need to throw up. I remember an incident before my trip to England where I was in my friend's car, we'd just had a huge buffet meal, and I ate way too much. This was before I was scared of throwing up really, but I ended up just barely making it out of her car and throwing up in the parking lot. This didn't really affect me as I knew I just ate too much. Then probably like a year later with no problems, I have this fear. That's the only incident I can remember that could've brought this on, but since I didn't get affected by it until much later when I'd pretty much forgotten about it, I don't know it that's it.",

It is like my whole life revolves around my intrusive thoughts. Even people around me have started commenting that I look sad all the time. I used to be so cheerful. It started out of nowhere. I was watching this movie about a man being sentenced to a long time in prison though he was innocent. And I started thinking about everything I ever did in my life. Even thought I have never done anything wrong, what if I get falsely accused or someone tries to frame me for something I did not do. I started researching different cases online. Read about laws which might be used against me...case histories.. .potential lawyers..etc etc.  I imagine situations where past/future boyfriends will resent me for breaking up and do something bad to me..it is gotten so bad that there barely goes a minute where I don't think about it.. I think about the shame this will bring to my parents. .I think I need help. I want to start enjoying life again. I want to wake up happy.

384,"Anxiety and Panic Attacks are a product of the body. Our bodies are memory organs just like our brains in which past experiences are stored. The body works differently than our brain in terms of storing memories. The brain communicates in terms of thoughts, the body in terms of feelings and emotions.

464,"I had an appointment at 5pm. I slept around 2:30pm and I usually sleep for 1-1.5 hrs max in the day, and sometimes 2. I don't know how I slept for a longer duration today and I was woken up by my therapist's call. Ofc i answered in a very sleepy voice and it took me 5-10 mins to gather my thoughts before I could even talk about them. It was fine after that, I had a nice session. But I'm fixating on the initial few minutes when I was sleepy and how 'unprofessional' it was of me and how the therapist would have thought that I was sleeping instead of focusing on therapy for my betterment, which might make her feel that I don't take it seriously. I'm also thinking if I should have said anything about the fact that I was sleeping, on the call, would it have made a difference if I would have known that she's okay with it? I don't know, instead of thinking of the session in a positive light I'm thinking of all of this!",

466,"Hey everyone, used to post here a little a few years back and have been going to therapy which has helped tremendously so have been lurking mostly lately. However, my anxiety has recently flaired up immensely due to some life circumstances- my work life has gotten immensely stressful, I'm worried about  the potential market crash on the horizon, my wife just had a miscarriage (very early in the pregnancy but still devastating), and my alcoholic mother who had been sober for 15 months recently relapsed and lied to me several times about it. I went to therapy this week and have scheduled an appointment for next week, but I am really struggling. Normally my anxiety has manifested during times of hardship with work or, more intensely, with my mother. It ranges from general anxiety through the day to intense panic attacks. However, this time around, I am really struggling to get motivated to do anything, which is exacerbating the problem. The only thing that has proven helpful is my friend giving me one of his adderall. I feel like this is based on depression, but I'm not sure. I've been practicing as much mindfulness/meditation/prayer/breathing exercises as I can, and have been diligent about my exercise (has been a huge factor in my success), but nothing seems to help. Have any of you experienced anything similar? If so, what seemed to help kick you into gear?",

469,"So thanks to a hospital near my house having an issue with their COmplete blood count reader that showed my wbc to be 3-6k higher than it really was all 6 times I went to that hospital (compared with 2 other hospitals CBC, and two different personal pathology laboratories) I developed severe health anxiety. I went through two months where I believed I had cancer and/or leukemia. I kept going back into that hospital for every little thing I felt or small discomfort since it was the closest one to my house and the wbc always showed 9.5k-11.5k never anything lower. I fell into this depressive state where I felt like I was going to die and something was horribly wrong with me. Now I can‚Äôt go day by day without thinking any little thing that happens in my body is serious and something is wrong with me. I‚Äôve never been a depressed person. I‚Äôm usually outgoing, happy, and always just wanted to party and go out and have ‚Äúfun‚Äù with different women never thinking about having something serious with one. Now I‚Äôm in this state where I don‚Äôt want to go out at all, I just worry about my health all the time and just rather be home googling my symptoms. My mentality has also changed to the fact that I want to settle down and find someone and have kids(being 23 years old) just because I‚Äôm thinking I might die some day and I want to leave something behind not leave alone. I hate that I have this mentality now and I really don‚Äôt know what to do my doctor thinks I need therapy but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the solution. What do you guys think?",

478,"I can't get over the fact that a year ago I was at my peak in terms of feeling secure, happy and mostly anxiety free. The one niggling thought I had was that I felt a bit lonely and wanted to make even more friends- the way I'm feeling now may be my fault for rushing into certain friendships. Fast forward to 2021, and a few 'little' things have happened this year which have slowly built up these feelings of worthlessness and insecurity inside me. I started the year with a huge allergic reaction on my face which I eventually recovered from but I can't stop picking at the scars. This gets worse any time something anxiety-inducing happens and it leads to a never ending cycle which I'm struggling to break. New scars lead to more anxiety and so on. When I say 'little' things have happened over the past year, I mean where my relationship with certain people who were important to me has crumbled as a result of something they did behind my back. I know you shouldn't take these things to heart because often it's a reflection of their own insecurities, but these incidents have left me feeling lonelier and unworthy of a close bond with anyone. Everyone around me ends up knowing what has happened between me and these people and it made me feel like an idiot. It's also caused me to start looking for attention in strange places like the internet which inevitably gets me into more of a bad situation. Outwardly I am still outgoing, friendly, confident, but inside I feel like a part of me has been ripped out which I want to get back. I feel like I have a personality which I need to keep up, as the funny and always talkative person in a group. I'm finding it hard to not place so much worth on the way my skin is looking but it genuinely causes me so much anxiety and upset.",

I've always endured pain and endured the sensations of pain and chalked them up to being normal, but this combined with my feelings of inadequacy and Crippling phobia of Death has manifested into Health anxiety...and Now I live each day in constant fear for my life. 10 hospital visits and the year isn't even over yet. Being told to calm down and that I don't know that I have anxiety or what having anxiety entails only frustrates me because I'm very familiar with anxiety and It's tormented me all my life and I've gone through it trying to pretend that everything is okay when I'm crumbling apart at the seems. I feel useless and I'm so lost. Everyone tells me I'm not a burden but I still feel like such a stress on my friends and family. I'm tired of feeling so miserable and so exhausted and so disconnected from everyone. I'm sick of the little pains and aches and tremors making my life hell, I wanna live I wanna do things but I'm so crippled by this fear of dying and being alone and unfulfilled in this life. The aches and pains in my chest, my neck, my head, my shoulders and my legs terrify me. I think I have a blood clot or that I'm going to have a heart attack or stroke, that there is something pressing on nerves in my head, That I've herniated a disk or that Im going to die in my sleep just before bed. I have to fall asleep in group calls with friends because if I sit in here for too long in my head I lose myself. I'm trying to learn to accept that it is my anxiety but I can't accept that. I don't understand anxiety anymore because it never use to do this to me...It didn't use to hurt like this. It didn't use to make me feel like every day was gonna be my last. And while I know dying is natural and that everyone will eventually experience it. That the dead don't speak and that I have no control over it, It does nothing but further this sensation of fear and dread and suffering. Everyday I wake up and I'm okay...but as the day sets in and I realize I'll have to face my anxiety my chest gets tight and I'm never fully relaxed, I'm always on edge; waiting for the symptoms to come and they do pains in the upper base of my neck, fluttering in my chest that feels like a muscles spasm deep within my chest, aches and throbbing pain in my legs. I just wanna be okay...Is it too much to ask to just feel safe and okay like I'm not a failure or a screw up or a burden or a waste of time and energy...to feel like I'll live to see the morning sun and do the things I've always wanted and accomplish something...",

494,Basically title. I am a college senior and so stressed about the future. Everyday I‚Äôm shocked that I‚Äôm a college senior and I feel so behind compared to my peers. You see my freshman year back in 2017 I had to take a medical leave bc of my ocd and anxiety so now I‚Äôm graduating a year later. Anyways because of my ocd and anxiety I never really networked that much or did any informational interviews. I first landed my first ever internship. I mean I was a research assistant but that was such low commitment. The way that people talk about post grad life is so scary and it‚Äôs terrifying to me that after this I‚Äôm done with college forever. I wish my college experience could have been better but it is what it is. Just like the way that people talk about post grad terrifies the living shit out of me and post grad I‚Äôll be living with my parents who have a terrible relationship and there‚Äôs lots of screaming and overall a terrible environment. I feel so constrained at home and free away at college but I‚Äôm broke and I can‚Äôt afford anything. It‚Äôs just the way that people talk about aging too is so depressing. I will be 23 in June and like that is so scary because I don‚Äôt look or act 23. In just full of so many anxieties. I know it‚Äôs normal but I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared shitless that I‚Äôm gonna end up jobless. I never been afraid of aging or anything but now I am. I miss being 17/18.,

I decided to get medication for it and was given Sertraline yesterday. 25mg daily for a week then 50mg after. I took the tablet and around 3 hours after, felt the worst I've ever felt. Non-stop vomiting to the point I couldn't move from the floor or hardly even get a second to breathe. Head spinning, feeling super sick etc. Much worse and intense than the anxiety.

532,"Hey all, sooo I take Citalopram mainly for my generalised anxiety disorder/depression long term and am getting into DBT therapy soon but lately I've been taking Seroquel at night to help me sleep (racing thoughts, anxiety/insomnia etc.). But my psychiatrist took me off it, he just didn't want me taking it all the time so gave me Clonidine instead. It seems to put me to sleep. I take 0.1mg at night. I've heard it's good in the day too but I haven't tried it, just wondering if anyone has for panic attacks etc? I will continue to use it for my restless nights/insomnia for now but if it works for full blown panic attacks in the day time at lower doses that's cool too - saves takes a benzo - I don't want to take those anymore. Thanks !",

I'm having problems being functional in school because I can't talk to people without locking up and feeling a rush of anxiety and I have panic attacks for absolutely no reason. I was doing group work in my Japanese class and I had to leave class to pop an Ativan (I got prescribed this for panic attacks). Same thing happened the next day, and I had to leave class to take anxiety medication (hydroxizine this time). Then because hydroxizine knocks me out for the whole day, I didn't go to the next class, and my class after that I was too anxious to go to. I cannot be around people without feeling panicky and I sweat profusely. Sometimes my back is drenched with sweat after class because I'm anxious during the entire class for pretty much no reason. and now it's making me depressed because I have no one to talk to.  can anyone with these problems tell me how I can deal with these problems. PS I already see a therapist but I don't get to go to therapy often because I don't have a lot of time to. I also can't go to social gatherings such as school clubs without having panic attacks.",

542,"So after many years of experiencing panic disorder and chronic anxiety to the point that I feel like I‚Äôm dying and have many physical symptoms that are super crippling to my everyday life. I finally built the courage to visit the doctors office after failing to do so many times and them cutting me off the meds because of my absence of visits. Anyways I broke down crying when they gave me the depression and anxiety screening and now with such a simple visit which what seemed like a living hell I‚Äôm back on my medication (celexa, Xanax) that I thought didn‚Äôt help but really it made me get through the darkest of times.. really hope I can make a quick recovery from this mentally and be back to feeling somewhat leveled out with the occasional panic attack cause right now it‚Äôs panic panic panic non stop and racing thoughts to the point I‚Äôm on the ground shaking and begging for this to just stop.

544,"Long read ahead. So I work at a pharmacy. A very busy, very understaffed corporate pharmacy. So after the pandemic things really got out of hand, we can't keep up with your prescription count anymore, on top of all our daily tasks as technicians. We also have a verbally abusive pharmacist who ""can do no wrong"" because if he gets fired corporate will have to close our pharmacy due to having no other ""manager"" (He doesn't actually hold the title of manager) That we need to legally operate. We might have 3 techs on a good day. Usually only 2. We have a drive through and front counter so that's where we're stuck as the pharmacist tries to force one person to work both to touch the mountain of filling scripts but due to our customer count it's not feasible. We never slow down. And customers are extremely rude and not understanding. I've been cursed at, screamed at, belittled, etc. All for stuff I can't control. Best I can do is get your stuff ready now you're here. Yes I know you dropped it off yesterday but it is what it is. So now we're drowning in customer complaints all while the district manager sends emails demanding we address them, demanding we do these tasks despite you know, two people. Demanding better customer service, etc. I have panic attacks badly, but can't even step out to take a moment to calm down and breathe. Instead I just help customers with shaky hands and tears running down my face. I've applied to at least five other places to get a job, but they haven't gotten back. I'm at my wits end. My life is consumed by the anxiety of work, the dread of having to go back, I worry constantly about work. I've saved up a good bit of money, but I'm hesitant to quit and have to dip into it until I can get another job, but I don't seem to have a choice. What should I do? Should I just grit my teeth and wait it out? I woke up with the worst panic attack of my life this morning, and I just keep getting worse.",
545,"I've had some anxiety my whole life but my anxiety got much worse than it ever has been in summer of 2020 because I developed constant tinnitus and didn't know why and I tend to have fear of the unknown so I was worried something was very wrong with me.  Then college came around and I had one of the worst and most stressful semesters I've ever had, so that made the anxiety even worse. Luckily I ended up finding out why I had tinnitus, I was diagnosed with a neurological disorder called visual snow syndrome which caused the tinnitus, and it also gives me some floaters and static in my vision. Finally knowing what was wrong with me decreased my anxiety about that a lot, but my anxiety was still horrible from school. All of a sudden I started having all problems with me that I feel are linked to the anxiety. It started with random abdominal pain and bad stomach issues like constipation, etc at least one or 2 weeks per month, and I never used to have problems like this. I have constant sinus pressure all around my nose and by my eyes. Things just keeps getting worse. It seems like bad anxiety about 1 or 2 things has stemmed into a full on anxiety disorder and nowadays I have have random anxiety attacks where my heart rate goes up and I get anxious, sometimes even for seemingly no reason.",

He called me stupid when we played one last round of league, kind of horsed around with me briefly like he was a fighting game character and put his hand on my shoulder with a condescending smirk when he saw me off.

Almost an anxiety of being asleep, it was so bad that I would force myself into exhaustion by either staying up until the sun came up or exercising to the point of exhaustion. I did find, however, that stream of consciousness writing helped immensely. Not with sleep, but in calming my mind down because I could see my thoughts in writing, in real-time. I didn't know this was an actual technique, I just tried it on a whim -- ended up writing for 4 straight hours at real-time speed and finished just over 31 pages of internal dialogue. It helped to read it during my more rational non-anxious states so I could analyze my thought patterns and identify what thoughts make me anxious. I really do recommend giving it a try -- it helped me survive while I waited for my medication to start working.",
